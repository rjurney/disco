# disco - Deep dIScovery COmpany parser
Unce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a package called [`cleanco`](https://github.com/psolin/cleanco). The package was quite useful when it came to company names parsing/cleaning (especially for initial experiments and straightforward name matching). However, it seemed that `cleanco` bit the Evil Queen's poisoned apple which caused that `cleanco` was not able to properly parse names in many non-western languages (Polish, Czech, and essentially all names in cyrillic, greek alphabet, chinese, etc). That's why the charming princes of Deep Discovery decided to take `cleanco` and enhance it, so that they can live happily ever after and parse whatever they need. And that's, dear kids, how `disco` was born.

#### Why disco?
Parsing companies through heuristics and keyword matching is like disco dancing. It was cool 30 years ago but when nobody is watching everybody does it. And also it comes from `deep DIScovery COmpany parsing` or `Deep dIScovery COmpany parsing`. 

### Goal 
As of now, `disco` is a heavily enhanced `cleanco` that we want to keep in private (for now). There is a lot of suboptimal parts but we can fix that once it starts being an issue.
